# Township

## Phase 1 - Birth of a Settlement
	Using totems to define a settlement area
		Heart totems are the core of a settlement from which the SMAI rules
		Expander totems extend the sphere of influence of the SMAI
			No need to have 5 settlements in the same village because it's so big
		Extender totems fulfill CraftingStation requirements in the local area
			So you don't have to place down a ton of ugly tables everywhere.
			They won't come cheap
			While having a larger area of coverage, they don't allow crafting

## Phase x
	

## Phase x
	Throwing people out of their settlements
		Add in reasons for people to still venture out;
			Farming:
				- Don't allow for certain plants to grow within a settlement (e.i Mushrooms, thistle)
				- Have pests spread among monoculture plants
				- Over foraging/hunting; Remove spawners around a settlement so that people have to go further for certain things.
			Have pests spread in settlements:
				- Settlements as a biome; rats, plagues, ect. Have jobs dealing with them
				- But also new stuff
			Powered Heart?
			NPC needs:
				- if a settlement gets big enough, NPCs get complacent/demand luxery goods, like Rimworld.

## Phase x
	Settlement Biome
		Have diffirent kinds of Settlement Biome's spawn around the Heart and Expanders.
		Outpost, Village, Town, City as the totem is further away removed from nature.
