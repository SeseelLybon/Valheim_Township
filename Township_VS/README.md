# Township

(note to self, this is the front page)

Township is a mod with the purpose of defining area's as part of a settlment, giving it certain bonusses like proxy workbenches, CraftingFromContainers-like behaviour but from chests throughout the settlement and Rimworld-like crafting, eventually supporting pseudo villagers to give life to these area's.
